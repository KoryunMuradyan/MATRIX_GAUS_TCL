Run script this format

tclsh << script_name.tcl >>  << input_file_name.txt >>

After this command automaticly generated  <<output.txt>> file with result

in << golden.txt>> file write  expected result

if result after  solver equal to golden result  in << output.txt>>  we can see << Test Passed >> 
otherway << Test Failed >>
